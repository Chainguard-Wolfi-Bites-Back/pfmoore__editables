Notes on coverage reporting
===========================

Handling the integration of coverage and tox is something of a black
art, as far as I can see. I've not been able to find a good explanation
of how or why any of the various approaches taken by projects actually
work.

The approach used here is taken from the one used by virtualenv. I have
some hope that it's a good one, as the virtualenv maintainer is also a
tox maintainer - so hopefully he knows how this stuff works! (Ironically,
tox itself uses a slightly different approach involving pytest-cov).

For now, this note is merely to highlight that I don't understand the
approach I'm using :-( In the longer term, I hope to replace this with
an actual explanation of what's going on here!
